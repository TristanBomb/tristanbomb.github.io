        This band of asteroids is the next important area of the Solar System after Mars. It is a vast region of space with huge amounts
        of wealth, but acquiring these resources is very difficult, and maintaining control over regions is impossible due to the distances
        between asteroids. Finding other outposts is difficult, and stealth is easy. It’s an excellent location for outposts,
        laboratories, mining, and everything in between. Setting up a base of operations here is a major milestone for all space programs.

            <p>
                This is my Life Success Manual - a project for Honors 350 designed to build a philosophical foundation for the life ahead of me. Most of the pages below are short articles, summarizing a number of potential positions on a given issue, along with my thoughts on those positions. Then, I'll pick one position that I feel will be practical and beneficial to my life. A few are formatted as arguments between competing positions, with counterarguments where necessary. The answers that work for me might not work for you, and they may not even be relevant, but that's okay! This isn't designed to be a universal guide, but rather a personal one. I've made it a website because I feel that doing so will increase the likelihood that I look at this again in the future; if it were just a packet of paper, it would end up stuffed away in a folder, to be lost and forgotten.
